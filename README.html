## Skye

## Introduction

Skye is a mobile application which tracks the user's location and provides current weather conditions for the user. It also suggests activities to do according to the weather in the user's area. For example, if it is raining, Skye suggests indoor activities like movie theaters, cafes, and museums.  On sunny warm days, Skye will suggest more outdoor oriented activites like parks and pools.  Skye is a useful tool for tourists and locals alike as it can help answer the age old question: "What should we do today?"
